          <p>My name is Darko Popović and I'm 26 years old. 
            I finished Musical High School and after that I changed my direction to the IT world. 
            I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. 
            In November 2019, I acquired Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Through faculty and internship
            I orientated primarly toward Web Development, but always trying to learn new programming languages, also read about new and better
            approaches. Until now I have completed two complete web apps using Angular 7, C# / .NET, Dapper and PostgreSQl, 
            also few Frontend parts for faculty projects using Angular. Now I am learning and making minor apps using Laravel, PHP, Ajax and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can describe myself as a creative and in constant seek for some kind of perfection. I really enjoy working
            in functional teams. Through growing up, football, music, projects and other parts of life I have learned what is the power beneath a functional team.
            Always looking forward to meet and work with new people, because of their unique vision, approach and experience. Profficient knowledge in english,
            both written and spoken communication. At the time, I'm learning german.
